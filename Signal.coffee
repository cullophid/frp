# Global stack to automatically track dependencies
# - When a signal is updated, it first puts itself on the dependency stack
# - When a signal is read, it checks the top of the stack to see who is reading
# - The reader gets added as a dependent of the readee
# - The readee gets added as a dependency of the reader
# - When the signal evaluation is done, the signal pops itself off the stack
dependencyStack = []

# Signals are functions representing values
# - Read a signal by calling it with no arguments
# - Write to a signal by calling it with the desired value as an argument
# - Define a signal by calling it with a function as an argument
# - This set the value as the function's output instead of the function itself
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If a signal reads other signals in it's definition, it is dependent on them
# - Signals automatically track what other signals they depend on
# - If any dependencies get updated, the dependent gets updated as well
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Signals should NOT have any external effects
# - It should only read other values and return its own value
# - For external effects, use observers instead
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# To "destory" a signal, just set its definition to null
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Signals are made up of 2 main parts
# - The core: The properties & methods which lets signals work
# - The interface: The function returned to the user to use
